# Developers

## Build with Sensei

This section contains everything you need to understand, integrate with, and extend the Sensei platform.

### Architecture

Deep dives into Sensei's three-layer agent architecture, technology stack, and design philosophy. Understand how cognitive, execution, and meta agents work together to deliver autonomous migration intelligence.

### Component Reference

Technical internals of Sensei's three core engines:

- **MABA** -- Data ingestion, structural/statistical/semantic analysis, and transformation code generation
- **KORA** -- Multi-dimensional validation, temporal state capture, and behavioral equivalence certification
- **AMANI** -- CRDT synchronization, differential privacy, federated learning, and offline-first design

### Integration

API reference, SDKs, CLI, webhooks, and connectors for integrating Sensei into your infrastructure.

### Reference

Configuration reference, environment variables, error codes, data type mappings, and other lookup tables.

### Design Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and RFCs documenting key technical decisions and proposed changes.
